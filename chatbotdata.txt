Mass Communication is a broad field, which is a combination of journalism, advertising, public relation, photography, film making, content writing etc.Note: Mass communication and journalism both are different.

If yes, why not make this your career.\u00a0Photography is one of those exciting professions where you can turn your hobby into a successful profession. Earlier, photography was a self-learned skill, but now many institutes have come with specialised courses in photography. As a photographer, you should be very technology-friendly for using a different camera, photography software and editing tools. Also, you have to be extremely creative; you should understand the essence of lighting, object and other effects involved in photography.With a great sense of awareness and hype being spread about photography, people now days always hire a professional photographer for special events. There is a wide range of specialisation in this field, like wildlife, wedding, war, landscape, sports and many more.\u00a0Examples: Raghu Rai, Dabboo Ratnani, Atul Kasbekar, Dayanita Singh, and Sooni Taraporevala are some of the famous and successful Indian photographers."

Business can be service-based, product-based or process-based. As an entrepreneur, you should develop your overall skills in product designing, marketing, selling, time management and also money management. Life of an entrepreneur is very flexible but also challenging. An entrepreneur has to be very hardworking, persistence, structured, well organised and a very brilliant leader.\u00a0\u00a0Example: Today, when you hear apple, the first thought that comes to your mind is Steve Jobs and not the fruit. It fits as a perfect example of a successful entrepreneur, whose success is self-explanatory. He did not build this overnight, he too started as a small start-up and stuck to it till the end.

What if you could do all of this at a single place and also built a career from it? If yes, you should become an air hostess or flight attendant.\u00a0A flight attendant looks after the passengers in the flight from start to end of their journey. Safety and need are of paramount importance. They are known as the cabin crew. As a flight attendant, you have to be very polite, respectful, and look after the safety of the passengers, and their needs (food, water, medicines). In general, you have to make the journey of your passenger as comfortable and safe as possible.\u00a0The cabin crew are highly trained for any emergencies like lack of oxygen, emergency landings and turbulence. The best part is that you get to travel domestically and internationally as a part of your job.\u00a0Example: We all have heard about the brave flight attendant Neerja Bhanot. She serves as the best example of how the cabin crew should consider the safety of their passenger as their primary responsibility. She also sets an example of spontaneous decision making abilities at the time of crisis."

If yes, you should explore the career option of fishery science.\u00a0\u00a0The term fishery refers to the action of catching or rearing fish through farming or aquaculture(the rearing of aquatic animals or the cultivation of aquatic plants for food). \u00a0Fishery involves rearing, catching, processing, packing and selling and conservation of the fish. Fishery science is the way of getting formal education about this entire process.\u00a0There are plenty of job opportunities under the private and government sector.\u00a0An aspirant can own their own fisheries-related business. Further, every state or country has fishery-related departments where one can apply for jobs.\u00a0Example: The salmon fishery of Alaska, the cod fishery off the Lofoten islands, and the tuna fishery of the Eastern Pacific are some great examples of fisheries available in the world."

If yes, you should consider genetics as your career option.\u00a0We always tend to compare the children to their parents with respect to their looks, as in does, the child looks more like the mother or the father. This similarity between the child and the parent has a scientific reason, the genes.\u00a0Genetics is the study of the heredity factor, which is transferred from a parent to their offsprings. Every child inherits certain traits, with few variations, from their parents like hair texture, eye colour, hair colour, height and skin colour.There is also a high possibility that certain diseases or disorders are transmitted through the genes to the offsprings. Genetics is the study of such genes their distribution, behaviours and structure in the human body.\u00a0There are various job opportunities in this field like the genetic counsellor, clinical researcher and research scientist.\u00a0\u00a0Example:\u00a0James D. Watson, George M. Church, David Suzuki, Mario Capecchi, Francis Collins, and M. S. Swaminathan are few of the most famous geneticists in the world.The concept of designer babies is developed and studied in the field of genetics. Here, particular genes associated with the disease are identified. Further, they are either altered or removed."

If yes, you need not be confused any more. Come and explore the career option of Bioinformatics.\u00a0Bioinformatics is a combination of biology and information technology.\u00a0Biology, when combined with computational tools, can give astonishingly fast, accurate and time-saving results. This integration of biology, along with computational tools gives rise to the field of bioinformatics.\u00a0This field is the integration of mathematics, statistics, biology, and computer science. With the help of bioinformatics, complex biological data can be analysed very quickly. The primary work of a bioinformatician is to develop codes and software for analysing biological database and samples. A bioinformatician makes scientific research more achievable.\u00a0Example: Through this field, you would code for different software that would handle the biological databases. For example, the human body has many proteins that play a critical role in our daily body functions. Dysfunction of any such protein can lead to a malfunction in our body. With the help of bioinformatics software, we can predict the structure of this protein and also its interaction with other proteins."
